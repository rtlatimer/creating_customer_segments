### Creating Customer Segments
by Robert Latimer

### Description

The goal of this project is to identify a wholesale distributor's different customer clusters by analyzing data pertaining to customer behaviors. By implementing a [PCA algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis) and [K-Means Clustering algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering), we are able to discover distinct groups of customers that display similar behaviors. Based upon the customer's cluster, the distributor is able to cater to each cluster's needs more effectively.

For full detail of the project, please see 'customer_segments_RLatimer_Revised.ipynb'.

### Install

This project requires **Python 2.7** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [iPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

### Code

All orignal coding was completed in the `customer_segments_RLatimer_Revised.ipynb` iPython Notebook file. Additional supporting code can be found in `renders.py`.

### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `creating_customer_segments/` (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```ipython notebook customer_segments_RLatimer_Revised.ipynb```
```jupyter notebook customer_segments_RLatimer_Revised.ipynb```

This will open the iPython Notebook software and project file in your browser.

## Data

The dataset used in this project is included as `customers.csv`. You can find more information on this dataset on the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wholesale+customers) page.
